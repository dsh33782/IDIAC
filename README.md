# IDIAC
Simple interactive stored program computer emulator supporting 10 instructions and 100 words of memory

Visit www.idiac.org to see sample programs and run your own programs interactively on IDIAC virtual stored program computer.  There are two versions of open source IDIAC.  One is written in PHP and runs on a shared web server at www.idiac.org.  This version executes about 1 million IDIAC instructions per second.  The other open source version of IDIAC is written in J2SE compiled to executable idiac.jar file which can be executed on any computer platform running J2SE runtime.  The java version of IDIAC executes over 50 million IDIAC instructions per second on a Windows 10 PC with Intel i7 core processor chip.

The website includes sample programs such as powers of 2 up to 64 bit limit, prime numbers, perfect numbers, and cacluation of Pi.

The hope is that this educational tool will encourage young people to take up software development as a career.  It has always been fun for me.
